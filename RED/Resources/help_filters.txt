Remove Empty Directories Plus (RED+) is based on Jonas John's original Remove Empty Directories (RED)

HINTS & FAQ

  * Right-click on a directory in the tree to get more options.

  * If you only care about speed you can activate "Fast mode", set delete mode
    to "Bypass recycle bin and directly delete dirs" and 
    "Pause between each deletion" to zero. This should give you a great speed 
    improvement but you will lose the recycle bin safety net and you won't see 
    the progress. I also measured the performance difference: 
    1000 empty dirs in normal mode take about 40 secs, with these settings 
    less than one second.

  * Why am I getting these annoying "cannot access file" or 
    "Access to ... is denied." errors? -> That means RED tried to
    scan or delete a file or directory that was locked by another 
    application. This is a safety feature to ensure that programs
    don't access files that are currently opened by another.

    To fix this problem close all other programs before using RED. 
    If that does not help you could try using tools such as
    Unlocker (http://cedrick.collomb.perso.sfr.fr/unlocker/).

COMMAND LINE
  * RED+.exe [-autosearch] "path"
      
      -autosearch is an OPTIONAL switch which searches the supplied path as soon 
      as RED+ starts. It MUST be supplied before "path"
      
      "path" is the path to be searched. It should be enclosed in double quotes.
