</div>
</li>
<li><span class="sx">Detect Paths in the Clipboard</span>
<div>Whenever you start the application <b>or</b> click on the <em>'Directory to be Searched'</em> textbox it will check if your clipboard contains a path to a directory <span class="eg">(e.g. C:\PATHNAME).</span> If it detects a directory it will prompt you to paste the value into the search directory textbox.</div>

</li>
<li><span class="sx">Pause between each deletion.</span>
<div>This specifies a number of milliseconds to pause after each directory is deleted. This was in the original RED but isn't really of any practical use. Zero is the default and means there is no delay.</div>

<div id="opts2ei">
<p><span class="sx">Windows Explorer Integration</span><br>
This places a <span class="nbn">Remove Empty Directories +</span> entry on the Explorer context menu which is available when you right-click on a directory in the Explorer navigation pane (left-hand side). From <b>v25.3.0.0</b> it is also on the context menu shown when right-clicking on the directory contents pane in (right hand side) in Explorer. This is a <b>Per User</b> setting.
</p>
<p>
<figure><img class="imgx" src="img/screen-S02eil3.png"></figure>
Check the <span class="nbn">Auto Search</span> box to include the auto search command line parameter in the integration.
</p>
<p>If the program is already integrated you can hover over the <span class="nbn">Uninstall</span> button to display a tooltip showing the command line used in the integration.</p>
<div class="hilt">
This option is <b>not</b> available if you are running <span class="red">RED+</span> from a removable drive. This option makes changes to the Windows Registry which point to a program which may no longer be available.
</div>
<div class="note">
<b>NOTE:</b> Versions before <em>v25.3.0.0</em> used a slightly different integration method that required <b>admin</b> rights to change. This old method still works but only for the left-hand side navigation pane of Explorer. You can tell if you have the old method installed because the <em>Uninstall</em> button has a shield on it. You can run later versions as admin to uninstall this method and then install the new method if you want.
