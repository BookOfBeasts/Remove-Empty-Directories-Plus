Remove Empty Directories Plus (aka <span class="red">RED+</span>) finds, displays, and deletes empty directories recursively below a given start folder. It allows you to create custom rules and filters for keeping and deleting folders (e.g. ignore directories  called <em>RECYCLER</em>, treat directories with empty files as empty etc).
</p>
<p>
<span class="red">RED+</span> is an enhanced version of <a href="https://www.jonasjohn.de/" target="_blank">Jonas John</a>"s Remove Empty Directories (aka <a href="https://github.com/hxseven/Remove-Empty-Directories/" target="_blank">RED</a>). I found RED very useful over the years, but I wanted a little bit more. Jonas hadn't updated RED in over 4 years and was unresponsive to email contact. And so <span class="red">RED+</span> was created.
</p>
<p>
<span class="red">RED+</span> is <b>not</b> a rewrite. It uses <b>much</b> of the same source code as the original RED but has had the settings, filter matching and filter editing portions rewritten. This was done to:
</p>
<ul> 
<li>Provide more flexible matching rules (Contains, Endswith, Startswith, Exact etc)</li>
<li>To allow rules to be selectively enabled / disabled</li>
<li>To make it portable</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is it good for?</h4>
<h5>From the original RED:</h5>
<blockquote>
One might think that searching and deleting empty directories is a trivial thing, but once you have hundreds of them it get"s really exhausting. That"s the reason Jonas made RED. It’s a small and simple tool that searches and deletes empty directories recursively below a given start folder. And before deleting anything it let’s you check all empty directories it found.
</blockquote>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Shows empty directories before deleting them</li>
 <li>Supports multiple delete modes (including Delete to recycle bin)</li>
 <li>User configurable filters to control directory processing</li>
 <li>Filter rules can be enabled / disabled as required</li>
 <li>Can treat directories with empty files as empty</li>
 <li>Portable</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="note">
<h4 class="red">You Use This Software Entirely At Your Own Risk!</h4>
I've been using versions of the original RED for many years, and this enhanced RED+ since July 2024 with no significant issues. But I offer no guarantee that it will work for you on your system.
</div>

<h4>System Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 or later</li>
<li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8</li>
<li>There is no installer. Just unzip into a folder of your choice and run it.</li>
</ul>

<div>
The <b>Search</b> tab on main screen is where you specify the directory where a search for empty directories is to begin, perform the search, and show the results.
It is also where you can delete the empty directories it has found.
The results of a search are shown in a treeview. The icons next to each directory are explained in the legend to the right of the treeview.
