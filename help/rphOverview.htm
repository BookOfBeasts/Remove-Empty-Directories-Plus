<div>
<p>
<span class="red">RED+</span> finds, displays, and deletes empty directories recursively below a given start folder.<br>
Furthermore, it allows you to create custom rules for keeping and deleting folders (e.g. treat directories with empty files as empty).
</p>
<p>
<span class="red">RED+</span> is an enhanced version of <a href="https://www.jonasjohn.de/">Jonas John</a>"s Remove Empty Directories (aka <a href="https://github.com/hxseven/Remove-Empty-Directories/">RED</a>). I found RED very useful over the years, but I wanted a little bit more. Jonas hadn"t updated RED in over 4 years and was unresponsive to email contact. And so <span class="red">RED+</span> was created.
</p>
<p>
<span class="red">RED+</span> is <b>not</b> a rewrite. It uses <b>much</b> of the same source code as the original RED but has had the filter matching and editing portions rewritten to provide more flexible and easy to edit rules. This was done to:
</p>
<ul> 
<li>Provide more flexible matching rules (Contains, Endswith, Startswith, Exact etc)</li>
<li>To allow rules to be selectively enabled / disabled</li>
<li>To make it portable</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is it good for?</h4>
<p><span class="nb">From the original RED author:</span></p>
<blockquote>
One might think that searching and deleting empty directories is a trivial thing, but once you have hundreds of them it get"s really exhausting. That"s the reason Jonas made RED. It’s a small and simple tool that searches and deletes empty directories recursively below a given start folder. And before deleting anything it let’s you check all empty directories it found.
</blockquote>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Shows empty directories before deleting them</li>
 <li>Supports multiple delete modes (including Delete to recycle bin)</li>
 <li>User configurable filters allow white and black listing of directories</li>
 <li>Filter rules can be enabled / disabled as required</li>
 <li>Can treat directories with empty files as empty</li>
 <li>Portable</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
The <b>Search</b> tab on main screen is where you specify the directory where a search for empty directories is to begin, perform the search, and show the results.
It is also where you can delete the empty directories it has found.
The results of a search are shown in a treeview. The icons next to each directory are explained in the legend to the right of the treeview.
